# Intergalactic Guardian Force I

In the year 2049, man has colonized Mars in response to over-population on Earth.
Everything was peaceful and good. Then in 2058, the invasion happened.
Aliens from a planet from a distant galaxy came and attacked the colony.
With the planet being mostly free of weapons, the human colonists could not defend themselves.
 
In response to this attack, the Intergalactic Guardian Force (IGF) was formed.
Their sole purpose is to defend humanity from the extra-terrestrial.
As the only survivor with a military background, you and your comrade have been tasked with reclaiming the base for humanity.
If you fail here, the invasion will progress to Earth too. This could put humans, and every other creature on planet Earth as extinct!

-----

Progress through each level simply by moving towards the top of the screen.
At the end of each level, there is a boss (level 1 & 2 are weaker bosses, and level 3 is the final boss).
Once the boss is defeated, the player may complete the level and continue their quest to reclaim the colony.
 
You will also encounter civilians scattered through the remains of the colony.
Walk up to a civilian to rescue them, and you will be rewarded with points!
If a civilian is killed by an enemy, or run off the screen, you will loose points.
